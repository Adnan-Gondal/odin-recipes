        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I am going to give you my Creole gumbo recipe. Most of the time, you
            could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a
            'pinch' of this and 'just enough of that' and 'two fingers of
            water,' and so on. This recipe is a combination of two recipes.
            Serve over hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated
            and many people like it better the next day. Bon appetit!

        <h3>What is Gumbo?</h3>
        <p>
            Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's
            shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick
            stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken,
            sausage, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens. As varied as the
            recipes can be, there are a few ingredients that all gumbos have in
            common: homemade stock; the "holy trinity" of celery, onions, and
            green peppers; and roux.

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings
                in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth.
                Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany
                brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat
                carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from
                heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and
                garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until
                all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the
                roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over
                medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15
                minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or
                soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until
                bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the
                boiling water.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper
                sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and
                tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2
                teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over
                medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes;
                remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering
                gumbo.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire
                sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes.
                Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before
                serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
