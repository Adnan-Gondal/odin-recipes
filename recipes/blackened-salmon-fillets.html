        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Salmon tends to be rather a large fish and you may want to ask your
            fishmonger for handy sized fillets for easy preparation and
            portioning. You will need between 150-200g per portion, depending on
            how hungry you are
        </p>

        <p>
            Salmon fillets should be firm to the touch and show no signs of
            greying flesh. Buy sustainably if possible. Unlike salmon steaks,
            which have a small circular bone in the centre, fillets are usually
            boneless, though you can find the odd pin bone so be sure to check
            before cooking.

            <br />

            <br />
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <br />
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <br />
            <li>4 salmon fillets, skin and bones removed</li>
            <br />
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <br />
        </ul>

        <br /><br />

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix paprika, cayenne pepper, onion powder, salt, white and black
                pepper, thyme, basil, and oregano together in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Brush salmon fillets on both sides with 1/4 cup butter, and
                sprinkle evenly with the spice mixture.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons melted butter in a large, heavy skillet over
                high heat. Add salmon and cook until blackened, 2 to 5 minutes.
                Lift fillets, add remaining melted butter to the skillet, and
                flip fillets into the butter. Cook until the other side is
                blackened and fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
